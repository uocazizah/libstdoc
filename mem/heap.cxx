/*
 * The yupiter dynamic memory allocator.
 *
 * The heap is a static arena of YUPITER_HEAP_SIZE bytes.  It needs no
 * system call, no operating system and no C library, which is what
 * lets this allocator live in a freestanding build, and it makes the
 * worst case leak bounded: a program that loses every pointer it owns
 * can lose at most YUPITER_HEAP_SIZE bytes, and the accounting below
 * still reports them.
 *
 * Layout.  The arena is one contiguous run of blocks.  Every block
 * starts with a header - a payload size, a state and a magic value -
 * followed by its payload.  The payload size is always a multiple of
 * the fundamental alignment, and the header is rounded up to that
 * alignment too, so a payload returned by yupiter_malloc is suitably
 * aligned for any object.  Allocation scans the run for the first
 * free block that fits and splits it when the leftover is large
 * enough to hold another block; release marks the block free and
 * merges it with its free neighbours, so the arena returns to a
 * single block after everything is released.
 *
 * Invariant.  No two adjacent blocks are free.  Every operation that
 * changes the list keeps that true: a split leaves the tail free next
 * to a block that was in use, and a release absorbs the free blocks on
 * both sides of the one being released.  A release therefore has at
 * most one free neighbour on each side and can merge in the same pass
 * that found the block, instead of walking the arena a second time.
 *
 * Validation.  yupiter_free and yupiter_free_safe classify a pointer
 * before touching anything: outside the arena or misaligned, not the
 * start of a block, already free (a double free), or a block whose
 * header does not add up.  The walk that confirms "start of a block"
 * is what rejects an interior pointer: only offsets the block list
 * actually steps over are accepted.
 *
 * Strict aliasing.  The arena is a declared "std::byte" array, so
 * inside this file it is only ever read and written through byte
 * lvalues; the block headers are moved in and out with yupiter_memcpy
 * rather than by casting the storage to a structure pointer.  What a
 * caller does with the payload it receives is the caller's own
 * effective type, exactly as with any other allocator.
 *
 * The public entry points carry the C linkage the headers declare, so
 * a C program links them under their unmangled names.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: yupiter creates no threads and provides no
 * synchronisation.
