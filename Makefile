# yupiter - top-level build
#
# Usage:
#
#     ./configure
#     make
#     make check
#     make install
#
# The build is a plain GNU Makefile on purpose: the project is small,
# every compiler flag is part of the design, and nothing about it needs
# a generator.  ./configure detects the target and writes config.mk.
#
# Out-of-source builds are not supported: the build tree is always
# ./build, which is removed by "make clean" and ignored by Git.
