/*
 * The same source is compiled twice: once with -DSTDOC_REFERENCE, when
 * the calls go to the host C library, and once linked against libstdoc.
 * CompareTwo.cmake runs both programs and compares their output byte
 * for byte, so a divergence is reported as a failing test on the spot.
 *
 * The golden file of test/format.c is a snapshot taken once, from a
 * reference library that is not present at test time.  This program
 * complements it by keeping a reference library in the comparison: the
 * cases are built at run time, so every combination of flags, width and
 * precision is covered without the file growing with them, and the
 * reference the output is compared against is a live one rather than a
 * file someone could regenerate from libstdoc by mistake.
 *
 * Every case prints the value the call returned as well as what it
 * wrote, so the return-count contract is compared too.  The program
 * writes no semicolon and no null byte, which is what lets the
 * comparison report the first differing line rather than only that the
 * two outputs are not equal.
