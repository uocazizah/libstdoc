/*
 * Staging, discarding, and the relative order of stdout and stderr.
 *
 * stdout is buffered and pushed out when a newline is staged; stderr is
 * unbuffered.  That is the documented behaviour of the two streams, and
 * it is pinned here in the only way that can pin it: the golden file is
 * the two streams merged into one, taken with "> file 2>&1", so it
 * records where a diagnostic lands relative to output that was produced
 * before it and flushed later.
 *
 * The staging buffer is crossed on purpose: a line longer than
 * YUPITER_BUFFER_SIZE has to bypass or refill the buffer and still
 * arrive whole.  A discarded stretch of bytes has to leave no trace,
 * while everything flushed before the discard has to survive it.
 *
 * The public interface covers all of this except the discard, whose
 * effect a caller can only observe through a failed formatted call.
 * The internal header is included for that one function; see its
 * declaration in include/yupiter_io.hxx.
