/*
 * One buffer, much larger than the stream buffer and larger than a
 * pipe can hold, handed to the write wrapper in a single call.
 *
 * CheckLargeWrite.cmake runs this program twice - once with stdout on a
 * regular file and once with stdout on a pipe - and checks the status,
 * the length and the bytes of each run.
 *
 * The two destinations are different kernel paths.  A file takes the
 * buffer as it is; a pipe has to carry it out in pipe-sized pieces
 * while the program is blocked in the call, and the kernel reports the
 * whole transfer as one count when it is done.  A wrapper that read a
 * count above 4095 as an error fails the first run's status; a wrapper
 * that lost part of a multi-piece transfer fails the second run's
 * bytes.
 *
 * The retry loop in yupiter_sys_write is not what the pipe run exercises:
 * a blocking write completes the whole transfer before it returns, so
 * the kernel does not hand back a short count here.  A short count is
 * defensive - it is what a terminal produces when a signal arrives
 * mid-write - and cannot be produced on demand; docs/testing records
 * that.  What the pipe run does pin is that a transfer which the kernel
 * has to carry out in pieces arrives whole and is reported as success.
 *
 * The size is well above the 4096 a kernel error can reach and well
 * above any pipe capacity, so neither property depends on timing.

     * unbuffered stream, never to stdout, because stdout is nothing but
     * the payload under test.
     *
     * The note has a second effect, and it is why the call is here
     * rather than left out: reaching for the stream objects gives the
     * read-write segment file-backed content.  A static executable
     * whose read-write segment has none gets that segment mapped from
     * a file offset past the end of the file, and the kernel then
     * terminates the process with SIGBUS on the first access to the
     * .bss that follows - before main() does anything.  Nothing to do
     * with this test in particular; it is a property of linking
     * without a C runtime.  See docs/building.
