 * The heap, exercised with small allocations only.
 *
 * The arena is 4096 bytes by default, so anything this test leaks
 * stays a few kilobytes at most, and the accounting in yupiter_mem.hxx
 * turns any leak into a failing check: after every scenario the live
 * byte and block counts must be back at zero.  The exhaustion scenario
 * deliberately fills the arena to prove that a full heap behaves -
 * yupiter_malloc reports it, printf falls back to its stack buffer, and
 * releasing everything restores the whole arena.
 *
 * Each check adds to a counter that becomes the exit status, so the
 * test carries its own verdict and needs no golden file.
