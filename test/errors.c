/*
 * The paths on which the formatted functions report failure.  Each
 * check adds to a counter that becomes the exit status, so the test
 * carries its own verdict and needs no golden file.
 *
 * The internal header is included deliberately: a stream bound to a
 * bad descriptor cannot be obtained through the public interface, and
 * the sticky-error behaviour that follows a failed write is worth
 * testing.
 *
 * A few cases use a format string that "-Wformat" rejects because the
 * library defines the behaviour on purpose: a width or precision
 * literal too large for an "int" and an empty format string.  Those
 * calls go through a function pointer, so the attribute on the
 * declaration does not apply and the rest of the file keeps the
 * compile-time check.
