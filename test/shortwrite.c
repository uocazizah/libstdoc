/*
 * Prove that yupiter_sys_write repeats the write system call until the
 * kernel has taken every byte.
 *
 * A short write cannot be produced on demand from a test: a blocking
 * write completes the whole transfer before it returns, and the cases
 * that do return early - a terminal whose output has been stopped and
 * interrupted by a signal, a non-blocking descriptor - need signal
 * handling or O_NONBLOCK, neither of which the library wraps.  The
 * test therefore replaces "yupiter_syscall3" for the duration of one
 * scenario: the mock records each request and returns a scripted
 * result, while every call it does not script (including the final
 * exit_group) is forwarded to test/rawsyscall_<processor>.S, a copy of
 * the real trampoline.
 *
 * The scenarios cover success after two short writes, a write that
 * makes no progress, a result larger than the request, and a kernel
 * error after a partial transfer.  Each check contributes to the exit
 * status, so the test carries its own verdict and needs no golden
 * file.  Diagnostics are only written once the script is inactive, so
 * they reach the real stderr.
