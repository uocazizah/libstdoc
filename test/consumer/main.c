/*
 * The program the install test builds against an installed libstdoc.
 *
 * It uses the two halves of the library a consumer is most likely to
 * reach for - the formatted output and the allocator - and exits
 * non-zero if either of them misbehaves, so a package that installs the
 * wrong header or an archive without the symbols fails the test instead
 * of passing on the strength of having linked.
 *
 * It is an ordinary hosted program on purpose: what is under test here
 * is the package, not the freestanding link, which the rest of the
 * suite already covers.
 *
 * The allocation is deliberately small.  The build accepts an arena of
 * 64 bytes, the whole of which has to cover the block headers as well as
 * the payload, and a consumer that asked for a page would fail the test
 * for a library that was configured for a very small heap rather than
 * for a package that was installed badly.
