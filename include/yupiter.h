 * runs.  The attribute is the only compiler extension in this header:
 * it changes no declaration and no calling convention, it is provided
 * by both GNU C and Clang, and it expands to nothing anywhere else, so
 * the header still compiles as ISO C17.
 *
 * The check is stricter than this interface in one place.  "%+p" and
 * "% p" are accepted by the functions, which follow the reference C
 * library and print "+0x1234" and " 0x1234", but "-Wformat" reports
 * the '+' and ' ' flags on a pointer conversion.  A caller that wants
 * that output can quiet the one diagnostic around the one call that

 * Write the formatted string described by "format" to yupiter_stdout.

 *   %d %i          signed decimal int
 *   %u             unsigned decimal int
 *   %o             unsigned octal int
 *   %x %X          unsigned hexadecimal int (lower/upper case)

 *   %s             null-terminated string
 *   %p             pointer (a null pointer prints as "(nil)")
 *   %%             a literal percent sign
 *
 * with the flags '-', '+', ' ' (space), '#' and '0'; an all-numeric
 * or '*' width; a '.' precision (numeric or '*'); and the length
 * modifiers 'hh', 'h', 'l', 'll', 'z', 't' and 'j'.
 *
 * The '+' and ' ' flags apply to the signed conversions and to %p.
 * For a non-null pointer they are printed in front of the "0x" prefix
 * - "%+p" prints "+0x1234" and "% p" prints " 0x1234" - which is what
 * the reference C library does.  A null pointer prints as "(nil)",
 * with no sign.  For the unsigned conversions the two flags are
 * ignored.
 *
 * A width given as a negative '*' argument is treated as the '-'
 * flag with a positive width.  A precision given as a negative '*'
 * argument is treated as if no precision were given.  A null "s"
 * conversion argument prints as "(null)", or as nothing at all when
 * the precision is narrower than that word.
 *
 * A width or precision written as a literal that does not fit in an
 * "int" makes the whole call fail, as does a field that would not fit
 * in the return value.
 *
 * Returns the number of characters written, or -1 if the stream
 * could not be written.  On failure the stream keeps a sticky error
 * and later calls fail immediately.
 *
 * Each call borrows one small scratch block from the yupiter heap
 * for the duration of the call and releases it before returning, so
 * a completed call leaves nothing allocated.  When the heap is
 * exhausted the call falls back to an internal stack buffer instead,
 * so running out of heap never makes the formatted functions fail.
