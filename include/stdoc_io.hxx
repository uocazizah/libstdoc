 * separated and individually testable.
 *
 * The declarations are wrapped in an "extern "C"" specification so
 * that the C++23 implementation defines them with the same linkage the
 * declarations promise, and the header itself is kept ISO C17 so that
 * the C test programs can include it too: a test that reaches an
 * internal interface is how the stream discard, the system-call
