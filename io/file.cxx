/*
 * The standard streams and their staging buffer.
 *
 * Every stream owns a fixed-size buffer embedded in the object, so
 * staging output performs no allocation.  Bytes are staged there and
 * handed to the operating system in a single write once the buffer is
 * full, once a newline is staged, or when the caller finishes a
 * complete formatted call.  Flushing eagerly on those three events
 * keeps output ordered without any exit-time hook, which the
 * freestanding startup path does not provide.
 *
 * The stream objects and the pointers to them are "constinit": the
 * freestanding startup path runs no constructors and walks no
 * ".init_array", so anything that would need dynamic initialization
 * must be rejected while the library is compiled instead of failing
 * silently at run time.

 * is staged.  stdout keeps a staging buffer.  stdin is marked
 * unbuffered as well, for the opposite reason: nothing writes to it,
