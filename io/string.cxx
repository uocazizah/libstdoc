/*
 * Minimal internal string and memory helpers.
 *
 * The library is linked with "-nostdlib", so it may not call strlen,
 * memcpy or memset from a host C library: those symbols would either
 * be missing at link time or, worse, silently resolve to a different
 * implementation than the one under test.  The helpers below are
 * therefore defined here and prefixed so that they never collide with
 * a host C library when yupiter is linked into a hosted program.
 *
 * The definitions carry the C linkage the internal header declares, so
 * the C test programs can link them under their unmangled names.
 *
 * None of these functions is part of the public API.
