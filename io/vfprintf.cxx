/*
 * The formatting engine behind stdoc_printf and stdoc_fprintf.
 *
 * The parser and the formatter are kept in one translation unit on
 * purpose: the specification has to be fully known before any byte is
 * emitted, and splitting parsing from emission would force the whole
 * specification to be marshalled through a second interface.
 *
 * Everything this file needs from the platform is the stream interface
 * and the heap, declared in "stdoc_io.hxx" and "<libstdoc.h>", so the
 * file compiles unchanged on any target that provides them.
 *
 * The scratch buffers of the formatting engine are borrowed from the
 * libstdoc heap for the duration of one formatted call and fall back
 * to stack storage when the heap is exhausted; no other allocation is
 * made here.
 *
 * Unsupported in this release: floating-point conversions, positional
 * arguments ("%1$s"), the "%n" conversion and the "I" / "'" flags.
 * An unrecognised conversion emits nothing and consumes nothing:
 * consuming it would need the type of the argument, which the format
 * never names.  The behaviour of the call is undefined by the standard
 * from that point on; emitting nothing is the least surprising choice
 * here.
 *
 * "stdoc_vfprintf" carries the C linkage the internal header declares,
 * so stdoc_printf and stdoc_fprintf reach it under its unmangled name.
