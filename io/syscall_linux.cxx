 * Operating-system system-call wrappers.
 *
 * This file is the only place where Linux system-call numbers and the
 * "-errno in the return register" convention appear.  Everything above
 * it works in terms of 0 / -1 results, so the rest of the library does
 * not depend on the operating system.  A write is retried for whatever
 * the kernel did not take, so a short write reaches the layer above as
 * a success that really did write everything it was given.
 *
 * Target: Linux, for the architectures the build accepts (aarch64 and
 * x86_64).  The system-call numbers are chosen from the compiler's own
 * target below, and an architecture without an entry there fails the
 * compilation instead of being silently mapped onto numbers that
 * belong to another one.  How the kernel is entered - which registers
 * carry the number, the arguments and the result - belongs to the
 * assembly trampolines (assembly/syscall_aarch64.S and
 * assembly/syscall_x86_64.S); this file sees a plain C function.
 *
 * The public wrappers carry the C linkage the internal header
 * declares, so the C tests can call them under their unmangled names.
