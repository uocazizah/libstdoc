 * Operating-system system-call wrappers.
 *
 * This file is the only place where Linux system-call numbers and the
 * "-errno in the return register" convention appear.  Everything above
 * it works in terms of 0 / -1 results, so the rest of the library does
 * not depend on the operating system.  A write is retried for whatever
 * the kernel did not take, so a short write reaches the layer above as
 * a success that really did write everything it was given.
 *
 * Target: Linux on aarch64 (the generic Linux system-call ABI, where
 * the number is carried in x8, arguments in x0..x5 and the result in
 * x0).  Other operating systems and architectures must provide their
 * own file and are rejected at configuration time rather than being
 * silently mapped onto these numbers.

 * is the very top of the range, above every count a successful call

 * an unsigned integer against -4095 separates the two in one step: a
 * failure lands in the top 4095 values of the unsigned range, while
 * every count - however large - stays below that.  Comparing against
 * the magnitude of the error instead would read any count of 4096 or
 * more as a failure, which is a whole buffer's worth of output
 * reported as lost.
